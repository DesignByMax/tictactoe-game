# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe game is a multi-player game that is fun and engaging. The app is fully responsive and is designed to work in mobile, tablet, or desktop.

## Getting Started

You can start the app by simply run or double click on the **index.html** file.
First download the "tictactoe" folder then `cd tictactoe` and run the index.html file.

## How to Play

Start by selecting the symbol for PLAYER 1 (letter X or Square) and PLAYER 2 (letter O or Sean Connery image).

Then, start the game by clicking in the square boxes starting with *PLAYER 1* (this is the default by design).
Remember that you can only choose your **player symbols** at the **beggining** of the game and as you start the game the dropdowns become disabled.

### Undo
You can undo your **LAST** movement only if you need to before the second player moves forward.
Undo button is located on the bottom left side of the page and it will enable/disables automatically to prevents unexpected results in the APP.

### Restart Game
You have an option of restarting the game at anytime during the game to start a brand new game. Restarting the game is making all the square boxes clear and start a new game.

### Keeping Scores
The app keeps the scores out of the total plays and displays them (player 1 & 2 scores) when you **WIN**.

### WIN vs TIE GAME
When you WON you will see the matching squares become **GREEN** and a window appears on the screen to show you the statistics about the game.
You can also TIE your game with your opponent at which you will be notified and can restart the game to continue your play.

### Prerequisites

This app can be improved by adding AI opponent but at the moment it only works with TWO USERS and manual inputs.

```
User1 vs User2
```

### Installing

No installation required as long as you have a browser such as Chrome. the app is fully functional in the browser.

## Recommendation

• I recommend using the `Chrome` browser for optimal experience but you can use Safari, Firefox, and IE11+ as well as any other modern browser.
• Restarting the webpage will reset all the score keepings and starts over a new game.
